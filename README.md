# Smart Audio Profile Manager

The "Smart Audio Profile Manager" is a mobile application that automatically changes the audio profile of a device based on its position. This feature allows users to conveniently adjust the device's audio settings without manually changing them.

The app uses various sensors such as the accelerometer and proximity sensors to detect the device's position. For example, if the device is detected to be upside down on a desk, the app will automatically switch the audio profile to silent mode. If it's in the user's hand, the app switches to the general audio profile. Similarly, when the device is in the user's pocket, the app changes the audio profile to vibration mode, and when it's on the desk, the audio profile switches back to general mode.

Users can customize the audio profiles according to their preferences, and the app also provides the option to create custom profiles for specific situations. For instance, users can set a specific audio profile for when they are driving or when they are in a meeting.
